Proposal for a Java-based client for the Maconomy 2.x REST API.

TODO: (in no particular order)

* Handle template-links
* Support different Maconomy data types: Integer, Real, Amount, Boolean, String, Date, Time, Enum, TimeDuration, Auto Timestamp
* Support login with domain credentials
* Implement navigation strategy for singleton containers
* Handle batch import actions
* Implement Performance logger using a request/response filter
* Implement filtering, sorting and field selection for filter queries
* Code generator for typed API, input from either xml files or specification webservice
* Guide on how to use this codebase in integrations, stand-alone tools etc (packaging)
* Unit test with typed API, e.g. JobBudgetTable rather than simply Table
* Support the environment web service
* Provide list of standard, common containers from Maconomy
