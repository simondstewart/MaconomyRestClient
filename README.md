Proposal for a Java-based client for the Maconomy 2.x REST API.

TODO: (in no particular order)

* Handle template-links
* Move authentication to request/response filter
* Implement navigation strategy for singleton containers
* Handle file up- and download as well as prints
* Handle batch import actions
* Implement Performance logger using a request/response filter
* Implement filtering, sorting and field selection for filter queries
* More offline tests
* Unit test with typed API, e.g. JobBudgetTable rather than simply Table
